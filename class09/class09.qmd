# PDB statistics:

THe PDB is the main database for structural infromation on biomolecules 

Download a CSV file from the PDB site (accessible from “Analyze” > “PDB Statistics” > “by Experimental Method and Molecular Type”. Move this CSV file into your RStudio project and use it to answer the following questions:


```{r}
db <- read.csv("PDB.csv")
#db
```

```{r}
knitr::kable(db)
```


> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.


```{r}
sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$X.ray)))
em.total <- sum(as.numeric(gsub(",", "", db$EM)))
em.total
```

Hmmm... I am doing the same thing over and over time to write a function

```{r}
#I will work with `x` as input

sum_comma <- function(x) {
# Substitute the comma and convert to numeric  
  sum(as.numeric( gsub( ",", "", x)))
}
```

```{r}
sum_comma(db$X.ray) / sum_comma(db$Total) 

```

For EM:

```{r}
round(sum_comma(db$EM) / sum_comma(db$Total), 3)
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
round( sum_comma(db$Total[1])/ sum_comma(db$Total), 2)
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED

> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

The structure is too low resolution to see H atoms. You need a sub1 Angstrom resolution to see Hydrogen.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

HOH308

# Working with structures in R:

We can use the `bio3d` package to read and perfomr bioinformatics calculations on PDB structures.

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

>Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

198

>Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

Mk1 and water

>Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?

# Predicting funcitional motions:
```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```


Perform a prediction of felxibility with a technique called NMA (Normal Mode Analysis)

```{r}
# Perform Flexibility Prediction
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```


Write out a "movie" (a.k.a. trajectory) pf the motion for viewing in Molstar

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
